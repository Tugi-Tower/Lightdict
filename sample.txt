English Paragraph:

Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has shown that emotional experiences are more likely to be encoded and retained in long-term memory than neutral ones. This phenomenon, often referred to as emotional enhancement of memory, arose from studies that began in the late 20th century. Researchers have found that when individuals feel intense emotions, such as fear or joy, the amygdala and hippocampus become more active, thereby facilitating memory consolidation. One participant, who had witnessed a traumatic accident, spoke about how vividly she remembered the event, while mundane details from the same day had completely fled her memory.
